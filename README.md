<B> Boston Housing Dataset </B>

The Boston Housing Dataset consists of price of houses in various places in Boston. 
Each record in the database describes a Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970
Alongside with price, the dataset also provide information such as Crime (CRIM), areas of non-retail business in the town (INDUS), the age of people who own the house (AGE), and there are many other attributes 

This project uses Various Machine Learning Techniques on this data set so as to infer the effectiveness of those ML models.
